**`Software Engineer (Developer/Student)`**

I am a driven individual currently pursuing a degree in software engineering at Southern New Hampshire University (Online). From a young age, I have always been fascinated with apps and websites and how they operate.

 <summary><h3>⛵️ Wurzburg's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
My coding journey commenced in 2022, during my tenure in sales at a furniture store where I grew increasingly frustrated with our operating system. This system was sluggish and lacked integration; the product catalog resided in one system, while checking stock availability relied on another system. It became a hassle for even the simplest tasks. The entire time I wished I knew how to code to build an app to make my job more efficient. So one day, I reached out to several schools to gather information on their computer science programs. Fast forward to today, and I find myself immersed in the challenging world of coding, occasionally tearing my hair out in the pursuit of mastery. 🚀💻
